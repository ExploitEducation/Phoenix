 * Even more format string fun!
 *
 * The world's leading expert on European wasps walks into a record shop. He
 * asks the assistant “Do you have ‘European Vespidae Acoustics Volume 2? I
 * believe it was released this week.”
 *
 * “Certainly,” replies the assistant. “Would you like to listen before you buy
 * it?”
 *
 * "That would be wonderful," says the expert, and puts on a pair of
 * headphones.
 *
 * He listens for a few moments and says to the assistant, “I'm terribly sorry,
 * but I am the world's leading expert on European wasps and this is not
 * accurate at all. I don't recognize any of those sounds. Are you sure this is
 * the correct recording?”
 *
 * The assistant checks the turntable, and replies that it is indeed European
 * Vespidae Acoustics Volume 2. The assistant apologizes and lifts the needle
 * onto the next track.
 *
 * Again the expert listens for a few moments and then says to the assistant,
 * "No, this just can't be right! I've been an expert in this field for 43
 * years and I still don't recognize any of these sounds."
 *
 * The assistant apologizes again and lifts the needle to the next track.
 *
 * The expert throws off the headphones as soon as it starts playing and is
 * fuming with rage.
 *
 * "This is outrageous false advertising! I am the world's leading expert on
 * European wasps and no European wasp has ever made a sound like the ones on
 * this record!"
 *
 * The manager of the shop overhears the commotion and walks over.
 *
 * "What seems to be the problem, sir?"
 *
 * "This is an outrage! I am the world's leading expert on European wasps.
 * Nobody knows more about them than I do. There is no way in hell that the
 * sounds on that record were made by European wasps!"
 *
 * The manager glances down and notices the problem instantly.
 *
 * "I'm terribly sorry, sir. It appears we've been playing you the bee side."
